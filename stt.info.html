    <h2>Diving at Coki Beach</h2>
    <p>
      The island is serviced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_E._King_Airport">Cyril E. King 
      International Airport</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Amalie_Harbor_Seaplane_Base"> Charlotte Amalie
      Harbor Seaplane Base.</a>
      <br>
      Passenger and limited car-ferry services to neighboring
      islands such as Water Island, Saint John, Saint Croix, 
      and the British Virgin Islands run regularly out of the
      Red Hook Terminal, Charlotte Amalie, and Crown Bay Marina.

      The United States Virgin Islands is the only place under United 
      States jurisdiction where the rule of the road is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic"
                                <strong>drive on the 
      left.</strong> This was inherited from what was the then-current Danish practice 
      at the time of the American acquisition in 1917. However, because the 
      islands are a U.S. territory, most cars are imported from the mainland
      United States and therefore the steering column is located on the left 
      side of the vehicle.
